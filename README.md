# Simple Blog Engine (Backend with Flask)

A basic backend API for a blog that allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Built using Python and the Flask microframework.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python and pip installed.
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd simple-blog-flask
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
4.  Run the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

* **`GET /posts`**: Get a list of all blog posts.
* **`GET /posts/<post_id>`**: Get a specific blog post by ID.
* **`POST /posts`**: Create a new blog post. Request body should be JSON with `title` and `content`.
* **`PUT /posts/<post_id>`**: Update an existing blog post. Request body should be JSON with `title` and/or `content`.
* **`DELETE /posts/<post_id>`**: Delete a blog post by ID.

## How to Test

You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, Insomnia, or even a web browser (for GET requests) to interact with the API endpoints. See the examples in the `Step 4: Test the API Endpoints` section of the instructions.

## Potential Improvements (Optional Future Enhancements)

* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Add a database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL) for persistent storage instead of JSON.
* Implement input validation and error handling.
* Add pagination for a large number of posts.
* Create a frontend to interact with this backend.
